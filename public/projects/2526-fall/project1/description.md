# Solar Energy Dashboard

An interactive dashboard that visualises solar array performance in real time. The app ingests mock telemetry (power, voltage, temperature) and displays live charts, daily summaries, and maintenance alerts.

Features
- Live time-series charts for power and voltage
- Per-panel health and temperature heatmaps
- Alerting for low output or temperature anomalies
- CSV export of selected time ranges

Tech stack
- React + Vite for the front-end
- D3 for charts and heatmaps
- Small Node script to simulate telemetry data

Quick demo
Open the dashboard and switch between live and historical views to inspect generation patterns and identify underperforming panels.
