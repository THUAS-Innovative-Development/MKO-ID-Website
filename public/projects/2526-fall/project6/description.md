
# Energy Usage Optimizer

Toolkit that demonstrates simple demand forecasting and scheduling to reduce household energy consumption. The demo includes a small optimizer that schedules flexible loads to flatten peaks and visualises expected savings.

Features

- Short-term load forecasting (mock data)
- Rule-based and optimization-based scheduling for flexible devices
- Visualisations showing baseline vs scheduled consumption
- Exportable scenario reports

Tech stack

- React for the UI
- Simple optimizer implemented in JavaScript (example code)
- Charting with Chart.js

Usage

Open the scenario builder, tweak device flexibilities and run the optimizer to compare projected consumption curves.
